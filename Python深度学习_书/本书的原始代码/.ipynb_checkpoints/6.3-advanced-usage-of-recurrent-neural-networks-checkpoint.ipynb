    "* *Recurrent dropout*, a specific, built-in way to use dropout to fight overfitting in recurrent layers.\n",
    "* *Stacking recurrent layers*, to increase the representational power of the network (at the cost of higher computational loads).\n",
    "* *Bidirectional recurrent layers*, which presents the same information to a recurrent network in different ways, increasing accuracy and \n",

    "\n",
    "* Preprocess the data to a format a neural network can ingest. This is easy: the data is already numerical, so we don't need to do any \n",
    "vectorization. However each timeseries in the data is on a different scale (e.g. temperature is typically between -20 and +30, but \n",
    "pressure, measured in mbar, is around 1000). So we will normalize each timeseries independently so that they all take small values on a \n",
    "similar scale.\n",
    "* Write a Python generator that takes our current array of float data and yields batches of data from the recent past, alongside with a \n",
    "target temperature in the future. Since the samples in our dataset are highly redundant (e.g. sample `N` and sample `N + 1` will have most \n",
    "of their timesteps in common), it would be very wasteful to explicitly allocate every sample. Instead, we will generate the samples on the \n",
    "fly using the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We preprocess the data by subtracting the mean of each timeseries and dividing by the standard deviation. We plan on using the first \n",
